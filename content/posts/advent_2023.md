> **TL;DR**: I probably won't stick with advent of code again but I'm going to try!

I once [eagerly declared my intention to finish Advent of Code](/posts/advent-one) and then didn't. I'm going to
be a bit more realistic about my expectations this year.

This is what I said in my [follow-up on accountability](/posts/advent-two/)...

> Next year I hope to do better, get farther, be faster, etc. I'll use Ruby again! And it'll be a lot of fun again! And
if it starts to feel like a chore at any point, I won't do it and that's fine.

So that's where we're starting from. I hope I get further this year but I also hope I spend a lot of December riding
my bike, taking photos, spending time with friends, catching up with family, playing video games, playing guitar,
playing D&D, cooking, continuing to learn French... mais vous m'avez compris.

I'm not sure how I end up collecting so many hobbies ðŸ˜…

Anyway, if you want to see exactly how long it is that overengineering solutions to word problems brings me joy, you
can follow along [on my Github account](https://github.com/RyanBrushett/adventofcode2023).
If you like programming, you should absolutely [check out Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) every year.

If you have the means, you can also [support the project](https://adventofcode.com/2023/support)!
