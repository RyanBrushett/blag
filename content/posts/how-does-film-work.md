I wrote a
[post about Pushing Delta 3200](/posts/pushing-delta-3200/)
which very lightly skimmed over a lot of actually pretty interesting things.
I gave a high-level overview of how I develop a specific black and white film
(with a lot about why I do it that way) but I'd like to
explore some of the technical stuff a bit more. It's a good excuse for me to
research these things.

Seems logical to talk about what film actually is and how it works.

_**Note:** I'm definitely not a physicist or a chemist so let's keep this simple._

### Plastic, Silver Salt, and... Jello?

In its most basic form, photographic film is a bunch of silver salt crystals
(we'll call them "grain" when they're developed),
suspended in gelatin, on a layer of protective plastic. The silver salts
(more precisely "silver halides") you'll find in photographic film are
silver chloride (`AgCl`), silver bromide (`AgBr`), and silver iodide (`AgI`).
These aren't completely dissimilar to a halide we're very familiar with,
sodium chloride (`NaCl`), but they do have a handy physical property that
makes them an essential part of photographic film: photosensitivity. They
darken very quickly when exposed to light!

These silver halides are suspended in gelatin to form the "photographic
emulsion" which is
[not really an emulsion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_(colloid))
but that's the term that stuck. Gelatin in this case is the same stuff
that makes Jello wiggle. I did some digging while writing this and couldn't
find a photographic film that does not use gelatin. I found this kind of
mind-blowing.

Since gelatin by itself would be relatively delicate, the silver-gelatin
suspension is applied to a plastic protective film and voilÃ ! You have
extremely basic black-and-white photographic film!
We'll talk about other elements of the design later.

### Film and Light

We have a strip of plastic with a layer of gelatin on it and a bunch of
chunky silver halide crystals suspended in the gelatin.
Let's say we expose it to some light. Photons, the fundamental particle that represents
electromagnetic radiation such as light (including UV and infrared light),
fly through our gelatin and some of them hit the surface of one of our silver
halide crystals.
When this happens, some of the silver halide molecules
[reduce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organic_redox_reaction)
leaving atoms of metallic silver on the crystal. Remember the darkening I
mentioned in the previous section? This is what's happening under the hood.
With sufficient exposure, there'll be clusters of metallic silver atoms
that will form what's called a
[latent image](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_image).
The latent image is persistent and quite stable, especially when kept cool.
And next you're off to the darkroom!

### Developing the Film

Development of a single crystal of silver halide is a binary thing. It's either
developed or it's not. `1` or `0`. It doesn't half happen but it also doesn't
happen immediately upon making contact with the developing solution.
Those clusters of metallic silver atoms created during exposure are catalysts
which shorten the
time it takes for the developer to flip the bit, shall we say.
It might he helpful to think of the development as being set to a kitchen timer.
The strength of the initial exposure lowers the amount of time initially set on the
timer. Once started, it'll tick it's way down until `ding!`, the entire silver
halide crystal has turned into dark, developed grain of metallic silver.

You have such a huge number of grains on any given frame that, even though
this is a binary process at the individual crystal level, smooth tonal gradients
from black to white are possible. Might be helpful to think about how gradients
are rendered on computer screens with millions of pixels. Now imagine instead of
pixels, you have many millions of non-uniform silver salt crystals.
Crystal size varies and bigger crystals can have bigger clusters
of silver which means the supposed kitchen timer is has a shorter initial time.
Also, not every crystal will necessarily be exposed in the same manner. If you
think of a soft light at the centre of the frame, the centre of that light is
where exposure was most intense, fading off as you move away from it. Thus, the
neighbouring crystals will have varied times set on their own little individual
kitchen timers. That said, detailed edges are also possible because sharp
delineations between exposed regions will result in sharp differences in the
delay times between neighbouring crystals. The neighbours don't talk to each
other, so if one has a big cluster of metallic silver due to intense exposure to
light, the one next door might not.

There is a point where something can be underexposed enough that it just can't
be developed. This is why pushing
film increases contrast dramatically. You can't develop detail that isn't there
so the least exposed areas will fail to develop while you push detail more and
more in the exposed areas.

Once the development step is done, we still have a bunch of undeveloped
silver halide crystals left lying around in the image in areas that were
not exposed to a lot of light and FWIW, the `fixing step`
(which happens after development) is what removes those.

Also: Keep in mind that we're dealing with negatives here. Highlights in the
resulting final image will be the ones that were exposed the most and turned
darker on the negative.
Shadows on the final image will be the parts that received less exposure
and (after the `fixing step`) result in a more transparent section of the negative.

### Improving the Design A Bit

Modern black and white film is a lot more complex than a piece of plastic
covered in a layer of Jello with some salt suspended in it. I mentioned before
that there are a few things we can do to make our film a bit more useful.

The biggest drawback in the simple design described above is that it's
actually only photosensitive to blue and UV light! This hurdle was overcome
at the start of the 1900's by adding dyes to the photographic emulsion to
make it
"[panchromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panchromatic_film)"
or sensitive to the full range of visible light.
When you think of a photographer working under a deep red light in a
darkroom, they're using
"[orthochromatic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthochromasia)"
film which is not sensitive to red light.

It's worth noting that modern black and white film is still quite sensitive to
UV light. Many photographers will overcome this by using a UV filter in front
of their lens to prevent the UV light from fogging up their images. Unless
of course that's what they're going for!

Modern films also have another layer that prevents light from
reflecting inside the film and causing fogging or discolouring. This is
called an
[anti-halation backing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-halation_backing).

### Revisiting Film Speed in Practical Terms

When we talk about film speed, we're describing how sensitive a film stock
is to light. Modern film comes in a number of speeds and are described
by film manufacturers with an ISO value. This might be written as ASA
but honestly, a comparison of film speeds and the resulting images sounds
like it should be its own post.

So to be precise: for a given lighting situation, with the other parameters
of exposure (shutter speed, aperture) kept the exact same, using the default
development technique, a "faster film" will result in a brighter image.

**So what is it that makes film faster or slower?**

Primarily, the size and design of the crystal structure of the silver
halides that are present in the photographic emulsion. Bigger crystals will
give more surface area for light to hit and thus make the film more
photosensitive. A
[wide light-facing surface area](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabular-grain_film)
(this is the T in
[Kodak T-max](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kodak_T-MAX))
also allows the film to be more efficient which enables both extremely fast, usable
films (such as Ilford Delta 3200 and T-Max P3200) and very detailed films at
user-friendly speeds (such as Kodak T-Max 100).

Good, slow, film will have finer grain. If that is shot
and developed well, the resulting image will be crisp with a very light texture and
lots of sharp detail. The faster the film, the grainier it gets until you end
up with a photograph that looks like it's been coated in road salt. I think
fast film looks awesome so "higher image quality" really depends on what you're
going for, but slower films can certainly capture more detail due to their design.
