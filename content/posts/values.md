I felt like I should write this down. If anyone finds this, if we'll be working together, if we've met briefly - maybe this will be useful in learning a little bit about what I value and how I think about certain things.

I also hope that this inspires you to think about what's important to you! Maybe it's a different list than mine. I think the exercise in thinking this stuff through is pretty valuable.

This is in no particular order and there's some overlap across some of these. Maybe this indicates they need to be further refined or clarified. I might edit this in the future or repost it as things change!

Broad themes appear to be growth, support, and community.

### Continuous improvement

I value curiosity, learning, and growth in myself and others. I love the uncomfortable feeling of not having a clue how to do something. Humans are smart and we're all generally capable of figuring things out! Even if I fuck up a bunch along the way, I like to think that I'm successfully discovering things that don't work.

Continuous improvement is not just about trying new things though. Neglecting to grow our knowledge or skill in the areas we consider ourselves comfortable leads to falling behind. "Failing to keep up with inflation", if you will. I love learning new approaches to solving problems, new perspectives, and new ways of using tools I'm familiar with. I love looking back at my code from months ago and thinking of how I'd make it better. I love pushing myself on my bike to go farther faster. This isn't to say that every ride is a training ride, but that improvement over time is important to me.

### Be humble

This is a huge part of continuous improvement but one that's definitely worth mentioning by itself. I think of this as always being willing to learn, not being afraid to say "I don't know!", and owning mistakes. Being humble helps build trust and makes disagreements or compromises easier. I also make a point of asking lots of questions, especially in disagreements, because I trust that everyone has something valuable to teach. I like to reflect on my own decisions and see what could have been done differently.

### Leave the campsite better than you found it

I really hope to make small, meaningful improvements to whatever situation I find myself in. That could be in the code I work on, mentoring someone to help them grow, teaching someone to fix something, cleaning up after someone else (even if it annoys me that they left a mess) - whatever. Just like, little ways I can go above and beyond to make something a little bit better. Even if they don't necessarily know it was me. It's not about recognition or hearing "thanks" or being appreciated, it's about making things better.

### Community

To me, community is about connection and inclusivity. Every member knowingly and willingly participates and therefore has a relationship with every other member in some way. A supportive community is tolerant, understanding, empowering, and problem-solving. They are excited to celebrate wins in the same way they are there to help soften blows. It accepts success and failure but strives for common growth and success and happiness and safety! The person who stole your bike is just as much a part of your community as the dentist.

### Authenticity, safety, and belonging

Diversity is strength and we must ensure that the spaces we inhabit - the communities we are a part of - allow people of any gender, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, age, culture, class, religion to safely and comfortably be their authentic selves. No "if" or "unless" or "but". It is important to me that I don't have to edit or filter any part of who I am. I try to create that same safety for others by listening and learning. I believe that creating an environment where people can genuinely express themselves — without judgment or hesitation — fosters strong connections and helps everyone be their best self! Celebrate each others' weirdness!

### The bigger picture

I like to remind myself to take a step back and make sure I'm looking at the bigger picture, especially in my professional life. Am I solving a given problem at the right level of abstraction? This habit can help make thoughtful, well-aligned choices that aren’t just about short-term gains, but are tied to larger goals and values. This can stop us from getting bogged down tackling papercuts or symptoms of problems and help us focus on leaving the campsite better than we found it.
