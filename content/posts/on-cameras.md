Camera choice is something I've been thinking a little bit about lately.

Despite a pile of reasons to do otherwise, I find myself reaching for the simplest, smallest, mechanical 35mm camera
I own nearly every time I take photos - my Leitz Leica M6 from '87. It tags along with me far more often than my
smarter and more flexible digital or film cameras.

I think I've figured out a few reasons why things seem to work out this way.

### Clearly smaller is easier to carry around right? Well, maybe not exactly

It seems like the most obvious reason why a little rangefinder with a 50mm lens would most often get the nod would be
size.
With no autofocus, no image stabilisation, no zoom, no mirror, no prism, no batteries, no flash, no grip, etc.
both camera and lens are significantly pared down and refined.

But in reality, it's not like an SLR is _that_ much bigger. I'm using the same little shoulder bag either way when it
comes to dragging my cameras along with me places. And there's not a weight difference. The rangefinder is pretty hefty.

It's not the difference in physical space or a weight difference directly that makes a camera more or less appealing
to me, I don't think (shout out to the Olympus 35RC though). Without those other tools
- especially autofocus - I think I feel more connected to the experience. I get to make more of the decisions,
so I feel like I'm more responsible for the output.

With no mirror, I can more effectively use lower shutter speeds without minor vibrations bothering me in the final
photo.

And being a mechanical device (bar the rudamentary light meter), I feel like it scratches the same itch as a
mechanical watch. You can feel and hear it working, especially when using slower shutter speeds!

### But it has a meter. It's sort of smart!

The meter in my rangefinder is pretty interesting. It's a centre-only circle (almost like a large spot meter)
represented in the viewfinder by
two arrows. Like `> <`. The idea is that when both arrows
are lit, the camera is saying that the middle of the frame will be exposed in the right ballpark.
Whichever arrow is brighter than the other tells you what
sort of direction you're erring in. Like if the right one is slightly brighter than the left, you're erring on the side
of "over" but you're there or thereabouts.
When one arrow is lit but the other is not, you are erring strongly toward over- or under-exposure.
It's subtle, but I don't feel like it's suggesting that it knows what is correct.

My SLRs, on the other hand, have complex matrices of metering sensors that are colour-sensitive and spread across the
entirety of the frame. They compare the scene they see with an internal "memory" of similar scenes to make smart
decisions. And they show how close you are to "correct" in third-stop increments, with a very clear "correct"
answer right in the middle. And to be honest, I rarely override it. My Nikon F6 seems like it pretty consistently
exposes negatives really well. My D850 is downright perfect.

OK so that's one less decision for me to have to make right? Sounds great! In reality, I feel more connected to the
process when my meter feels like it's suggesting things to me rather than making decisions for me. I love the little
vague meter in my rangefinder. I don't mind agreeing with it but I also don't mind disagreeing with it and deciding to
try something else entirely. It feels like a helpful friend that provides advice but says "you do you".

Disagreeing with my D850 feels like I must be making a mistake...

### This sounds like a great argument for using an old-school film SLR

Yeah maybe it is. I have an FM10 and I don't use it. I bought an F6 and shot that infinitely more than I did my FM10.
I don't really know right now quite why. Maybe it's a lens issue. The two lenses I own that do work with it
are autofocus lenses with the AF disabled. The focusing is not as precise or as pleasant as something like a
Leica 50mm Summicron.
The FM10 is mechanical and will work without a battery but it still has mirror slap and finder blackout.

### And there's something (small) to be said for build quality

The FM10 is a lot of plastic. It's probably durable enough for me, really. I imagine it's probably very repairable
(other than the meter), but it doesn't feel as confident. Especially the film advance crank. And an autofocus lens
with the AF disabled is an entirely different experience than a lens designed to be focused by hand.

But realistically, there's nothing specific about the FM10 that would make it less usable for someone like me.
It is a really great camera. Writing this out, having thought about what I love about the M6, I'll
be revisiting my FM10 again to feel it out.

### I hate being the centre of attention

I think another subtle drawback of, for example, the F6 with a 50mm 1.8D is that it _looks impressive_. Or at least it
looks "professional". It's relatively loud and it looks complicated and it attracts attention in ways that make me feel
a bit uncomfortable. The D850 is especially guilty of this. It's built like a tank, it's ergonomically efficient, it's
fast as hell, and it projects that to a viewer.

In contrast, an M6 looks unremarkable. If it wasn't for that damn red dot, it wouldn't look like anything at all.
It's so easy to take it out and blend in.

It's probably worth saying now that _all of this is a Ryan problem_. The D850 looks impressive exactly because it is.
It's an incredibly effective tool for art, wildlife, wedding, and sports photogs. I'm none of those things. I'm
a lad with a hobby who is overly self-conscious.

This might be a concern for certain street photographers but I do believe that, for the photos I take, if I did so
confidently with a Nikon D850, no harm would ever come to me or my gear.

This segues sort of nicely into a really great point to be made about tools like the Nikon D850...

### A rangefinder can't do everything

And this is entirely true. There's certainly a time and place for something like a Nikon D850 or an F6 and that's any
time speed and precision is required. Whenever I go birdwatching, without question, I'm taking an SLR. I imagine a
rangefinder with a
500mm lens would be pretty hilarious.

And indeed there's something magical about the Nikon 70-200 lenses. They're inspiring to use and the image quality is
outrageous! At that point though, the physical space issue is too real and these things just aren't walk-around lenses.
Nothing attracts attention like my Nikkor 70-200 or my 500mm birding lens. Honestly it kind of sucks because the
70-200 f2.6E is glorious and I almost never want to actually take it out and get stared at.

### Digital vs. film?!?

I was thinking about whether or not I'd use a Leica M10 or M11 more than my M6 and I think the answer is no and I think
that's my fault. To be honest, my Fuji X100V made me realise something I've been missing about digital cameras, or
rather a trap I've caught myself in. RAW. Lightroom. Editing.

The Fuji X100V brought me back to shooting a digital camera more like a film camera. I put a preset on in the camera,
set the quality to JPG, and shoot. I don't retouch anything. This is a stark contrast to how I treat my D850 which
I shoot entirely RAW. Every image is processed in Lightroom. They all take time. I realised that I kind of half-ass
(or maybe 3/4-ass?) almost every picture I shoot with my D850. I got into the trap of "finishing/fixing it in post."

In contrast, I make all of those decisions in advance when I pick up a 35mm film camera, in the form of having to pick
a film to load. This, in combination with being _slowed down by the lack of autofocus and smart meter_ means I am
forced to whole-ass every frame. I'm far, far more connected and present. No spraying and praying. No half-assing.
No fixing it in post. The Fuji X100V helped me realise this.

### Take-aways

I think by putting this out into the world and "thinking out loud" about it, I have the following conclusions that
are maybe some food for thought:

1. A stronger connection to the scene I'm capturing results in photos I'm happier with. For me, I found that this
connection is at its deepest when I'm shooting film with a relatively 'dumb' mechanical camera.
1. MAYBE this connection could also be achieved by forcing certain constraints on how I use very smart cameras.
Notably by not shooting RAW and by trying to slow down a bit.
1. I've found that setting a JPG preset on my Fuji X100V inspired me more than shooting RAW on my D850 has. Being
able to connect to my phone and share the photos immediately without some multi-hour post-process step has been
massive for me.
1. There's a time and a place. A D850 or an F6 is an invaluable tool in some specific situations, usually on the
telephoto end of things or where precise focus of quick-moving subjects is necessary. Birds and sports come to mind.
1. Maybe it's time for me to think of RAW as a backup rather than the "most correct" form as digital photograph.
1. Build quality matters. Slowing down or adding constraints is not a substitute for a purpose-built piece of
mechanical beauty. An autofocus lens with the AF disabled will not invoke the same feeling as
a lens designed to be focused by hand.
1. I don't like 'fixing thigns in post' or post-production in general. I've found myself happiest when I shoot a
photograph on film,
develop it myself, scan it in a naÃ¯ve way (no RAW), and observe the result. Equally, I've enjoyed working with a lab
that I trust. Shout out to GPC Labworks in Ottawa and E6it! in Toronto.
