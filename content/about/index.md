I grew up and lived most of my life on [the island of Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)) which is easily the best place on the planet. The people, the land, the sea, the culture - it's such a special place to call home. I got my B.Sc. studying computer science at [Memorial University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_University_of_Newfoundland) in St. John's. I wasn't _great_ at school but I loved it and worked hard.

In 2016 I moved to Ontario to work for [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/) where I'm now a senior production engineer so that worked out pretty well. It's a great environment to learn and grow. I use mostly Ruby to build tools that make it easy for developers to understand and manage the infrastructure they're using. I love it when the work that I do helps other people do their best work.

I have a lot of hobbies but I spend most of my time taking photos and playing guitar. I really like wine, animals, and loud music. I have two cats and they hate each other but I love them and they love me so it's ok.

##### Previous work stuff

- I spent some time as a sysadmin in the computer science department at my university and that's where I found out I loved working with Linux.
- I did an internship at [Cognos](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/products/cognos-analytics) that became a nearly two year thing. I learned a lot about system administration, unix, operations, etc.
- After I graduated in 2014, I worked at a little startup (it's no longer a startup) in St. John's called [Verafin](https://verafin.com/) where I did operations stuff with AWS. I learned a lot about automating infrastructure, scalability, etc.
