I grew up and lived most of my life on
[the island of Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(island))
which is easily the best place on the planet. The people, the land, the sea, the culture - it's such a special place
to call home. I got my B.Sc. studying computer science at
[Memorial University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_University_of_Newfoundland) in St. John's. I wasn't
_great_ at school but I loved it and worked hard.

In 2016 I moved to Ontario to work for [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/) where I'm now an engineering manager
so that worked out pretty well. It's a great environment to learn and grow. I spent a lot of years making it
easy for developers to understand and manage the infrastructure their apps are using. In January 2021 I started working
with a team that focuses on gradual typing of Ruby at scale and later that year I took over managing that team. We've
broadened our scope to more generally include developer tools for Rubyists and I'm excited about what we have planned!
A lot of the work that I do now is open-source which makes me really happy. I love it when the work that I do helps
other people do their best work.

I have a lot of hobbies but I spend most of my time taking photos and playing guitar. I really like wine, animals, and
loud music. I have two cats and they hate each other but I love them and they love me so it's ok.

##### Previous work stuff

- I spent some time as a sysadmin in the computer science department at my university and that's where I found out I
loved working with Linux.
- I did an internship at [Cognos](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/products/cognos-analytics) that became a nearly two year
thing. I learned a lot about system administration, unix, operations, etc.
- After I graduated in 2014, I worked at a little startup (it's no longer a startup) in St. John's called
[Verafin](https://verafin.com/) where I did operations stuff with AWS. I learned a lot about automating infrastructure,
scalability, etc.
