I grew up and lived most of my life on [the island of Newfoundland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newfoundland_(island)) which is easily the best place on the planet. The people, the land, the sea, the culture - it's such a special place to call home. I got my B.Sc. studying computer science at [Memorial University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memorial_University_of_Newfoundland) in St. John's. I wasn't _great_ at school but I loved it and&nbsp;I&nbsp;worked&nbsp;hard.

In 2022, I started working at a company called [Fullscript](https://fullscript.com/careers), hacking on Developer tools. I love it when the work that I do helps other people do their&nbsp;best&nbsp;work!

I have a lot of hobbies but I spend most of my time riding or tinkering with my bike. I really like wine, animals, cameras, guitars, and loud music. I have two cats and they hate each other but I love them and they love me so&nbsp;it's&nbsp;ok.

I made a little post about [things that are important to me](/posts/values) that you can read for a bit more detail.

##### Previous work stuff

- In 2016, I moved to Ontario to work for [Shopify](https://shopify.engineering/). I spent a lot of years making it easy for developers to understand and manage the infrastructure used by their applications in production. In January 2021 I started working with a team that focuses on gradual typing of Ruby at scale and later that year I took over managing that team! We broadened our focus to include IDE tools for Ruby developers. I'm really proud of the work we did together! I left in 2022 after just over&nbsp;six&nbsp;years.
- When I graduated in 2014, I worked at a little startup (it's no longer a startup) in St. John's called [Verafin](https://verafin.com/) where I did operations stuff with AWS. I learned a lot about automating infrastructure,&nbsp;scalability,&nbsp;etc.
- I did an internship at [Cognos](https://www.ibm.com/ca-en/products/cognos-analytics) that became a nearly two year thing. I learned a lot about system administration, unix,&nbsp;operations,&nbsp;etc.
- I spent some time as a sysadmin in the computer science department at my university and that's where I found out I loved working&nbsp;with&nbsp;Linux.
